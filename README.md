## Overview

GroveMoE is an **open-source** family of large language models developed by the **AGI Center, Ant Group Research**  that introduces **Grove MoE**, a new sparse architecture using **adjugate experts** for dynamic computation allocation.  
With **33 B total parameters** and **3.14‚Äì3.28 B active parameters per token**, GroveMoE delivers **state-of-the-art** results across reasoning, mathematics, and code generation while keeping inference costs low.  
**‚ö†Ô∏è Model weights are comming soon.**

## Key Highlights
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Architecture** | Novel **adjugate experts** grouped with ordinary experts; shared computation is executed once, then reused, cutting FLOPs. |
| **Sparse Activation** | 33 B params total, only **3.14‚Äì3.28 B active** per token. |
| **Training** | Mid-training + SFT, up-cycled from **Qwen3-30B-A3B-Base**; preserves prior knowledge while adding new capabilities. |
| **Open** | Weights, configs will be fully released under Apache 2.0 upon approval. |
